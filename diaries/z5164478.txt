Week 1
We established our group and decided on the SkillsBackpack as our project. I worked with Kevin on the problem statement 
and backgroud for our Proposal. Also as I was designated the Scrum master, once we had decided on the various user stories 
I orgnised them onto the Confluence and Jira pages. I also started thinking about how we could categorise them and place them 
into the various sprints.

Week 2
This week I mainly worked on finalising the proposal by going over all the details as well as sorting out all our user stories
and acceptance criteria into the relevant tasks and sprint plan based on our team discussion earlier in the week. We also 
established the story points and priority of the stories. I also did some research on APIs to get a better on them in
preparation for the first sprint.

Week 3
We started our first sprint this week which mainly revolved around setting up the database and determining API endpoints. My 
role was mainly focused on finalising our proposal which was due on Sunday where I collated all our different parts and added 
in a few new sections such as the differentiating features of our system. I also began looking into Candidate accounts and how
to enable them to change their account details, passwords, delete account, etc.
