Week 1
Group formed. Discussed project options with group and decided on Skills Backpack.
I created Jira and added all members to project. Kevin linked a Confluence page for our proposal.
Discussed roles with group and designated Alex as scrum master.
Discussed then came up with week 1 deliverables with group and divided tasks up to be completed by our Friday meeting.
Together with Charmaine and Gordon, wrote up User Stories and prioritised them.
Briefly discussed available software tools and libraries to use for the project.
Interface and flow diagrams as well as system architecture is planned for next week.

Week 2
Completed all required storyboards with Charmaine and made changes to corresponding user stories where required. I am currently re-formatting our Project Proposal on Confluence for PDF export.
With the entire team, planned all sprints (decided on 6 weekly sprints, ~8 story points each). Divided roles for backend, frontend, data and API development.
Started looking into JSON formatting required to end data from frontend forms to database with Charmaine.
