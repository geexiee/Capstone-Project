Week 1
Group formed. Discussed project options with group and decided on Skills Backpack.
I created Jira and added all members to project. Kevin linked a Confluence page for our proposal.
Discussed roles with group and designated Alex as scrum master.
Discussed then came up with week 1 deliverables with group and divided tasks up to be completed by our Friday meeting.
Together with Charmaine and Gordon, wrote up User Stories and prioritised them.
Briefly discussed available software tools and libraries to use for the project.
Interface and flow diagrams as well as system architecture is planned for next week.

Week 2
Completed all required storyboards with Charmaine and made changes to corresponding user stories where required. I am currently re-formatting our Project Proposal on Confluence for PDF export.
With the entire team, planned all sprints (decided on 6 weekly sprints, ~8 story points each). Divided roles for backend, frontend, data and API development.
Started looking into JSON formatting required to end data from frontend forms to database with Charmaine.

Week 3
Divided roles for Sprint 1. Started on front-end login and register forms with Charmaine.
Set up a generic home page, generic registration form, and looked into creating tabs to redirect different users to different forms using React and Material UI.
Completed: Register UI but no actual data being sent to back-end yet.

Week 4
Tabs to redirect different user types to different forms working.
Form input (email, password, confirm password) validation working.
Worked with Charmaine and Kevin on connecting back-end APIs to the front-end form UIs we have created.
