Week 1
We formed our group and established our project (SkillsBackpack). I set up Confluence pages for collboration and documentation. 
I worked with Alex on writing the problem statement and project background.
I also researched some existing APIs and software frameworks we could use for our project.
We had another meeting halfway through the week to catch up and assigned more work for the coming week.

Week 2
I primarily worked on the ER diagram this week, establishing the data layers of our system and how our backend systems would interact.
I also did more research into the frameworks we would use for our project and set up the team GitHub repository with all the 
base files and skeletons for our application.
